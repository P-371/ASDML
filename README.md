ASDML was inspired by the following languages, files and file formats:

* nginx.conf
* QML
* CSS
* JSON

## Specification ##

The base language specification can be found [here](SPEC.md)

## Language Extensions ##

Extended language features are available

* [HTML](HTML.md) - write ASDML and transpile it to HTML

## Extensions For IDEs and Editors ##

### Visual Studio Code ###

* [P-371/ASDML](src/VSCodeExtension) (official)

## Libraries ##

### C# ###

* [P-371/ASDML.NET](src/ASDML.NET) (official)

## Submission ##

Do you have an idea how to improve ASDML? Do you have an extension for an IDE? Do you have a library in a programming language to manage ASDML? Let me know.
